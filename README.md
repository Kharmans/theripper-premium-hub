# TheRipper93's Premium Hub

Automatically check for my premium modules updates.

## Downloading

Currently the download option is non functional but in the future it will bring you to the patreon post for the download - no update of this module is required when the function goes live.

## Options

By default the module will check on startup and will also check for modules that are installed but not enabled, you can change these options in the module settings
