The size of the token is determined by the "Asset Grid Size" field (eg, 100 will make the token 1x1, 200 2x2 etc...)>> Dropping a **sound** will create it on the scene, The sound will be created with a Diameter equal to the "Asset Grid Size" (in units). Eg. With a asset grid size of 100 the sound will be created with a 50ft radius.>> If you have an input selected (for example the token image in the token config) Selecting a file in the sidebar picker will set that text input to the clicked fileDownload: https://www.patreon.com/posts/74214151
