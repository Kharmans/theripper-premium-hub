<@&975747410678657125>- Fixed bug that caused issues with mastercrafted (and possibly other modules) when the "Cast from Content Links" option was enabled

## Version 1.2
> - Added new Cast From Content Links feature (misc tab)I found myself rarely using magic items handling modules since i don't care much about the tracking provided, but sometimes i just wished i could cast a spell from an item description without having to import it into the sheet. This little tweak does just that. Click on the magic wand and the you'll be able to cast a spell (or use an item) directly from an item description without the need to have the item on the actor.Download: https://www.patreon.com/posts/80944136
