## Version 1.5
**Added optimizations:**> - If 3D Canvas is detected 3D Portraits will share libraries with 3D Canvas avoiding loading an unecessary 2mb+ of librearies on startup>> - If Portraits are disabled (for example if you are just using it for heroforge integration) libraries will not be loaded>> - If 3D Canvas is detected 3D Portraits will use the 3D Canvas more efficient model loader thus avoiding loading files multiple times.
